The "debug menu" (also called the "maintenance mode") on a [Garmin](https://www.garmin.com/garmin/cms/site/us) Nuvi 750 is a utility that allows you to reset your device back to factory settings. You can reset any addresses saved to the device as well as custom points of interest, such as restaurants, hotels or whatever. You don't need to do anything special to enter this menu on the device, you simply just need to press in the right location at the right time.

## Steps to Enter Debug Menu

1. Turn off your Garmin Nuvi 750.
2. Press and hold your finger in the lower, right-hand corner of the Nuvi 750's touchscreen.
3. Turn on your Nuvi 750 while continuing to press on the unit's screen. This will launch the debug menu on the device.
4. Press "Yes" or "No" when asked if you want to restore your device factory settings. You can also press the other button on-screen to continue into "maintenance" or "debug" mode.


## Exit the Debug Menu

To exit out this special menu on your Garmin Nuvi 750, simply turn the device off and turn it back on again.
