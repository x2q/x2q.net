## Update to Latest OS X

Upgrade to the latest version of [OS X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X).

If you are upgrading from Lion to Mountain Lion, then tere’s no need to visit a
store and fetch a box, and install a bunch of discs. Just click the Mac App
Store icon on your Mac. Buy OS X Mountain Lion. And your Mac does the rest.



## Clean System and User Caches etc. Using OnyX

OnyX is an utility for Mac OS X which allows you to run system maintenance, to
configure some hidden parameters of the Finder, Dock, QuickTime, Safari, Mail,
iTunes, login window, Spotlight, and many of Apple’s applications, to delete
caches, to remove a certain number of files and folders that may become
cumbersome, and more.

´Download OnyZ´ and install it.

## Remove Startup Items in System Preferences

If you are tired of applications launching automatically when you start your Mac, then you can
actually remove those Startup items from launching and slow down your performance.

Startup items are quite easy to remove with a few clicks and tweaks in the System Preferences.

Navigate to `System Preferences` > `Users & Groups`. Now select you click your username, and then click on the `Login Items` tab.

Here you are able to see all items launched at startup.
